# Mesa Homebrew Tap

The official [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for [Mesa](https://www.mesa.dev) products.

## What is Mesa?

Time-travel file storage with Git semantics. Code review, CI, model
attribution, and BYOC. All built for autonomous systems.

## What is a Homebrew Tap?

A tap is a third-party repository of Homebrew packages (called "formulae").
Adding this tap lets you install Mesa's tools with a single command. For more
on taps, see the [Homebrew docs](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps).

## Quick Start

Install a Mesa formula directly (this adds the tap automatically):

```sh
brew install mesa-dot-dev/tap/<formula>
```

Or add the tap first, then install:

```sh
brew tap mesa-dot-dev/tap
brew install <formula>
```
